# CrowHead-V1
This is an open source Crow Head Version 1 (I make one every year, this one was made in 2021)

Heres me wearing it!

All Seams on the Segment Guide (Check the Images folder [Crow Head V1/Images]) must either be welded or glued together.
Note that the eyes use M3 Screws to hold them inplace (this was done so it would be easy to swap) as well as the jaw joint requires a 22mm OD Ball Bearing that is 7mm thick.
